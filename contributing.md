# Contributing to Shadcn Organization

Thank you for considering contributing to the Shadcn organization! Before you start contributing, please take a moment to read through this guide to understand how you can contribute effectively.

## Introduction

Welcome to Shadcn! We are a community focused on creating re-usable components using Radix UI and Tailwind CSS. However, it's important to clarify that Shadcn is not a traditional component library that you install as a dependency via npm. Instead, it's a collection of re-usable components that you can freely copy and paste into your projects.

### What do we mean by "not a component library"?

When we say Shadcn is not a component library, we mean that you won't find it published on npm or distributed as a standalone package. Instead, Shadcn provides you with a set of code snippets and components that you can cherry-pick for your projects. You have the freedom to copy and paste these components directly into your application's codebase.

### How to use Shadcn components?

1. **Pick the Components You Need:** Explore the Shadcn repository to find the components that best suit your project's requirements.

2. **Copy and Paste:** Simply copy the code of the selected component(s) from the Shadcn repository.

3. **Customize as You Like:** The copied code is now yours to modify and customize to fit your specific needs. You have full control over how these components look and behave in your application.

4. **Reference and Learn:** Use Shadcn as a reference and learning resource to build your own component libraries. Feel free to contribute back to Shadcn if you create improvements or new components that might benefit others in the community.
